# Repo Overview

This project aims to identify authors based on their distinctive word 
usage patterns. By analyzing word frequencies, we can make educated 
guesses about the likely author of a given sentence. Through this 
approach, we can determine the author who is most likely to have written a 
sentence based on the frequency of words they commonly use

For example, let's consider the sentence "It was a dark and stormy night." 
By examining the frequency of words used by different authors, we can 
identify the author whose word patterns align most closely with the given 
sentence
